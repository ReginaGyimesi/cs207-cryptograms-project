he shaved the peach to prove a point
courage and stupidity were all he had
he found rain fascinating yet unpleasant
i currently have four windows open up and i do not know why
the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long
for the last time he said he would quit drinking soda after this last coke
we will not allow you to bring your pet armadillo along
he did not heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well
the secret ingredient to his wonderful life was crime
stop waiting for exceptional things to just happen
not all people who wander are lost
people keep telling me orange but i still prefer pink
a dead duck does not fly backward
his laugh was short and humorless
she does not study german on monday
